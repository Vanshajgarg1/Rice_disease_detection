# Rice_disease_detection
A deep learning-based model to detect and classify common rice plant diseases from leaf images. Built with transfer learning on CNN architectures (EfficientNet/MobileNet) using the PlantVillage dataset, the system can identify diseases such as Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, and Leaf Smut with high accuracy.
